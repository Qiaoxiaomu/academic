# Notes summary

This notebook is  created by Hanyu Zheng for Multivariate Analysis, a MOOC course. I made this online notebook maily for futrue use, when I want to refer to something about this subject, I just need to open my websit and review what I want.

The course is provided by Prof. Jingyuan Liu from Xiamen University. You can find the course [here](https://www.icourse163.org/course/XMU1-1461267164). Thanks Prof. Liu for her excellent teaching and spoken English. 

{{% callout note %}}
This is actually a personal notebook, it only includes what I think is important. So it is not as comprehensive as the instructor's original vedios and slides.
