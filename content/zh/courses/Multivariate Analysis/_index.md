# Notes summary

This notebook is  created by Hanyu Zheng for Multivariate Analysis, a MOOC course. Please note that **I just take down what I think is important and valuable**, so it's not as comprehesive as Prof. Liu 's course nor her slides. I made this online notebook maily for futrue use, when I want to refer to something about this subject, I just need to open my websit and review what I want.

The course is provided by Prof. Jingyuan Liu from Xiamen University. You can find the course [here](https://www.icourse163.org/course/XMU1-1461267164).
