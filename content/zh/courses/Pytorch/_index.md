# Notebook Information

This notebook if for taking down materials during my PyTorch self-studing. It also includes homeworks and projects to [Deep Learning 2021](https://nickzhy.com/courses/deep-learning/) given by Hung-yi Lee from Nation Taiwan University. 

{{% callout note %}}
This is actually a personal notebook, it only includes what I think is important and valuable. So it is not as comprehensive as the original pytorch documents nor instructor's slides.
