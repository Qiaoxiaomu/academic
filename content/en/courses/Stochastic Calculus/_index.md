# Notebook Information

This notebook if for taking down materials during my Stochastic Calculus self-studing. The viedeo I use cannot be provided here since it is the online master course of some university.

{{% callout note %}}
This is actually a personal notebook, it only includes what I think is important and valuable. So it is not as comprehensive as the original pytorch documents nor instructor's slides.
